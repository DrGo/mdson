COMMUNICABLE DISEASE-What you need to know				
				
epidemic theory (effective and basic reproduction numbers, epidemic thresholds) and techniques for infectious disease data (construction and use of epidemic curves, generation numbers, exceptional reporting and identification of significant clusters);				
				
Here are the facts you need - firstly about the disease: 				
				
1	Agent: 	Is it a virus / bacteria / protozoa? You don't need to remember the exact name nor whether it is a RNA / DNA virus etc etc		
2	What sort of illness does it cause - diarrhoea / paralysis etc			
3	How do you diagnose it - serology / stool microscopy etc			
4	Occurrence - two parts to this. Firstly, what is the world wide distribution? Secondly, in your own country is it sporadic, endemic, occasional epidemics, or imported cases only?			
5	Reservoir - e.g. cattle, man only. 			
6	Mode of transmission: not many option here. Is it - parenteral, faecal-oral, airborne or droplet spread, or direct contact? 			
7	Incubation - don't try to memorise this for the exam: it's too much to learn. In real life always look it up. 			
8	Communicability - this refers to the period during which a case can infect other people. 			
9	Susceptibility and resistance - who in a population is susceptible to this infection? Everyone may be susceptibility, or many people may be resistant because of previous infection or immunisation programmes. 			
				
Now about control of the disease: 				
				
1	Prevention - general measures: don't forget for many diseases, control is achieved by good housing, safe water supplies and enough food. Prevention also includes safe disposal of needles and clinical waste (e.g. the 'yellow bag' system which allows separation of potentially contaminated waste from ordinary household waste.) 			
2	Prevention - specific measures			
3	Isolation, disinfection, quarantine - mostly reserved for the very scary diseases such as viral haemorrhagic fevers, plague, SARS etc. 			
4	Immunisation			
5	Management of contacts - e.g. contacts who are foodhandlers
